For my `web-content`, I have transferred both the haproxy.html file and the style.css file, but I did ask ChatGPT for help creating a new index.html file that simply says "It Works".
After that I went to work on my `Dockerfile` which is just a simple two line file that tells docker hub the image will run on httpd version 2.4, and copies the files from `web-content` into the instances `/htdocs` folder.<br><br>

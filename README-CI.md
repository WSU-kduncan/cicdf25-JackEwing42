For my `web-content`, I have transferred both the haproxy.html file and the style.css file, but I did ask ChatGPT for help creating a new index.html file that simply says "It Works".
After that I went to work on my `Dockerfile` which is just a simple two line file that tells docker hub the image will run on httpd version 2.4, and copies the files from `web-content` into the instances `/htdocs` folder.<br><br>

There are many ways to build an image on Docker Hub, one you can do given the materials above is by using a Command Line Interface (CLI). In a CLI, the user must login to docker using `docker login`, then the user can build an image based on the given Dockerfile with a command like `docker build -t jackewing/cicd-project:latest .`. The `:latest` is called a "tag", which is used to identify a specific version of an image. it's more or less used as a name for the image version. To properly test and therfore use the image, the user must use the command `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jackewing/cicd-project:latest`. Do remember through all of this that these are not the specific commands used for these actions, they are just examples. The `-d` is to run the instance in detatched mode, and the `-p` is to assign port connections between the host and the network.<br><br>
Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) is simple in Docker Hub. first the user needs to go to their `Account Seettings` page and click the `Personal Access Tokens` tab on the left. After that the user needs to click `Generate New Token`, this will prompt the user for a name, an expiration date, and the tokens permissions. Finally the user is shown the token and must promptly store it somewhere as the token will never be shown again after closing the page. To create a repo secret, the user must first click the `Settings` tab, next they scroll down to the `Secrets and Variables` then click `Actions`. Next they need to click `New Repository Secret`. The user is then prompted to enter a name for the secret and the text the secret will refer to. For this project I have created two secrets called `DOCKER_TOKEN` and `DOCKER_USERNAME` containing the PAT and my Docker Hub Username respectively.<br><br>
Workflows can be triggered multiple ways. The way that it was triggered in this project was a Push on the Main Branch. But the Workflow can be triggered other ways, such as a pull request instead of a push, a manual dispatch using `workflow_dispatch:` as the trigger event after `on:`, and the workflow can be triggered at a certain time using the `schedule trigger:` followed by `- cron "* * * * *"`, the asterisks should be replaced with the time you desire to reun the workflow. The steps followed through the workflow are followed in descending order, these can be multiple
